# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project_week_4
Welcome to the Human Activity Recognition project! In this project, my goal is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, ultimately preparing it in a tidy format that can be used for further analysis. The project is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0, provided by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz and his team.

### Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Collection and Integration:** I begin by downloading the data and reading it in R. This data is divided into training and test sets, with each set containing observations for different activities like walking, sitting, standing, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** I perform various data cleaning steps, including merging the training and test sets, extracting only the measurements related to mean and standard deviation, assigning descriptive activity names, and labeling variables appropriately.

3. **Tidy Data Creation:** Once the data is cleaned and transformed, I create a second, independent tidy data set that contains the average of each variable for each activity and subject. This data set will be in a structured format, making it suitable for analysis.

### Context

The Human Activity Recognition project is a fundamental step in data science and analysis. The dataset used is derived from accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from smartphones worn by volunteers during various activities. This type of data has broad applications in fields like fitness tracking, health monitoring, and wearable technology research.

Through this project, I aim to showcase my skills in data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation, while also adhering to best practices in data science and documentation.
