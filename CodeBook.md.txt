## Code Book
This code book describes the variables, data, and transformations performed to clean the data for the project. The data 
used in this project is from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. More information about
the data can be found at UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Variables
subjectID: An identifier for the subject who performed the activity. Ranges from 1 to 30.
activityID: An identifier for the activity performed by the subject. Ranges from 1 to 6, each corresponding to a specific 
activity type.
activityType: Descriptive label for the activity performed, corresponding to the activityID.
##Other variables: These variables represent the measurements related to mean and standard deviation of various features 
collected from smartphone sensors. The names of these variables are self-explanatory and based on the feature names 
provided in the original data set.

## Transformations
Merging Datasets: The training and test datasets were read and combined to form one dataset. The training and test data 
were merged along with activity and subject information.
Extracting Mean and Standard Deviation: Only the measurements related to mean and standard deviation were extracted from 
the dataset.
Descriptive Activity Names: Descriptive activity names were added to the dataset based on the activity ID.
Labeling Variables: Descriptive variable names were assigned to the dataset columns.
Creating Tidy Dataset: A new tidy dataset was created by aggregating the data based on subject and activity and calculating
the mean of each variable for each combination.

## Output
The output of the project is a tidy data set file named tidySet.txt. This file contains the aggregated data with the 
average of each variable for each activity and subject.

## Github Repository
The script used for data collection, cleaning, and transformation can be found in the GitHub repository.
